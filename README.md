# Assignment 02 - Web Chat Server (Instructions)
> Course: CSCI 2020U: Software Systems Development and Integration

This is the template for your Assignment 02.

## Overview
You want to create a web chat server with multiple rooms. This will allow you and your friends to chat privately.

- Check the `Canvas/Assingments/Assignment 02` for more the detailed instructions.

### WebChatServer - Endpoints

**Connect to the websocket**

From the `ChatServer` class. This will create a new client connect to the web server. The server and client communicate using `json` messages.
- `ws://localhost:8080/WSChatServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT/ws/{roomID}`


**GET a new (unique) room code**

From the `ChatServlet` class. This will return a `text/plain` content type.
- `http://localhost:8080/WSChatServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT/chat-servlet`
See a sample of the response data:
```
1B9FN
```

### WebChatServer - client

Your client is in the `webapp` folder, when started the application will run at `http://localhost:8080/WSChatServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT/`; which will load the `index.html` file.

Your client-side code will be in the `js/index.js` javascript file.

> Obs. Feel free to create other helper classes as you see fit.

A. ------- PROJECT INFORMATION --------

Group Members: Jacob Rempel, Ryan Warraner, Bilal Nazar

Within this project, we were able to establish a chat server that is able to handle multiple clients within a
chatroom and allow users the ability to create mutltiple chatrooms. The application allows for randomly generated
chatroom codes, making chatrooms only visible to the select users/client within that chatroom. The application 
greets and announces whenever a new user/client has joined. Timestamps and the username will be printed along the 
sent messages. The user/client interacts with a beautifully displayed UI allowing them to see current chatrooms
and access information about the contributors of the application. 

B. ---------- IMPROVEMENTS ------------

The improvements that were made to the UI was:

    * Including a "Menu Navigation" Bar, located at the top-left corner of the screen, clicking on it would display the NAV, allowing for a more clean and easy user experince.

    * Animations were added to the buttons when the users cursor were to hover over them. Clicking the "Menu" 
    icon created an animation of the sidebar popping out from the side.

    * A "Send" Button was implemented to allow the user to send messages by simply clicking a button.

    * A "Refresh Room List Button" was implemented to allow the user to know about the current chatrooms taking
    place

The improvements that were made to the Functionality of the program was:

    * A functional "Send" Button was implemented to allow the user to send messages by simply clicking a button.

    * A functional "Refresh Room List Button" was implemented to allow the user to know about the current chatrooms taking place

    * Chat room history gets saved when a new user enters a chatroom, allowing the user to keep up with the 
    previous conversation

    * Whenever a user wants to enter a chatroom they are equired to create a new user account

    * The chatroom is able to send and recieve images between users, allowing for a more personal experience.


C. ---------- HOW TO RUN --------------

Step 1)
Open the Github of the assignment and copy the link of the assignment code.

Step 2:
First find a suitable folder to store the assignment code. After, open your computers terminal and type 
the git command "git clone + [link]". (Place the copied link from github in the position of [link])

Step 3: 
After successfully loading the assignment folder, access the ChatServer.java by going through
w24-csci2020u-assignment02-rempel-nazar-warrener/src/main/java/com/example/webchatserver/ChatServer.java

Once in the file edit the Run Configurations of the file by setting up a Local Glassfish Server running 
GlassFish 7.0.11. Then assign the JRE to JDK 21, specifiy the Domain as domain1, setup the initial URL to be
http://localhost:8080/WSChatServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT/. Then go to Deployment and select the artifact "WSChatServer: war exploded". 
Finally, apply and save these changes.

Step 4:
Click Run File. The Server would have successfully opened, automatically displaying the index.html file.

Step 5)
Begin by clicking on the button "Create New Room", this button will setup a new chatroom for the user. 

Step 6)
Afterwards, the user will be shown a message asking to state a name. After typing in a name, the user can either
press the "SEND" button or hit "Enter" on their keyboard. Finally, the chatroom will display a welcome message
stating a new user has entered the server and the user can now freely send messages within chatroom using the 
given input bar. At the top it will display what room the user is currently in. If a user would like to send 
an image they can select "Choose File" below the input bar. A user can select whatever image they would like uploaded, then press the "Send Image" button.

Step 7)
To add an additional user, copy and paste the URL to a new tab. From here, the user can either click "Create 
New Room" to start another chatroom or click "Refresh Room List" which will display the currently active
chatrooms below the "message input bar". The user can then select which room they would like to enter. After
selecting the room they would like to join, Step 6) will repeat but this time chat history will be retrieved
and the conversation can continue with the new client. When one of the users leaves, closing the tab. Other 
users within the chatroom will be notified that the user has left.

Step 8)
There will be a "Menu" icon on the top left of the screen. Clicking on it will allow you to navigate to the 
"About" page

D. ---------- OTHER RESOURCES ----------

Resources that were used to assist with the solution were from the StackOverflow forums that assisted 
with troubleshooting the backend and frontend of the websites. The use of Lab Codes and In-Class codes were
used to help develop many aspects of the backend. The use of MDN Web Docs and w3Schools was used to help with 
the creation of the Front-End.
